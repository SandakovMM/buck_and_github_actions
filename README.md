# What is all about

Hello there! So I wondered if we could build things with BUCK inside github actions. This is the repository where I am trying to do the trick.

The code itself - nothing interesting, just hello world.
The interesting part is github actions pipeline. And maybe BUCK parts also, but it shouldn't be a surprise for you if you are really familiar with the tool.
